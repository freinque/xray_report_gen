Cardiothymic silhouette is within normal limits for size. Pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable.,The cardiothymic silhouette is within normal limits for size.,"
The candidate report is missing a finding that is present in the reference report. The reference report mentions that the ""Pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable"", but this is not mentioned in the candidate report.

[Clinically Significant Errors]:
(b) Missing a finding present in the reference: 1. Pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable.

[Clinically Insignificant Errors]:
None.

[Matched Findings]:
1. The cardiothymic silhouette is within normal limits for size.",0.5,0,1,0,0,0,0,1
The cardiac contours are normal.,The cardiac contours are normal.,"
The candidate report is identical to the reference report. There are no discrepancies between the two reports.

[Matched Findings]:
1. Normal heart size.",1.0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1
Heart of normal size and contour.,Heart and mediastinum of normal size and contour.,"
The candidate report includes an additional finding (""mediastinum"") that is not mentioned in the reference report. This is a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall interpretation of the report but it is an error nonetheless.
