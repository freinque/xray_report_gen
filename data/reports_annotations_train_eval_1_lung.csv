Calcified granulomas noted. Symmetric apical scarring.,"Calcified granulomas noted. XXXX symmetric apical scarring. The diaphragms are flattened, and the chest is somewhat XXXX shaped. Pulmonary vascularity is unremarkable.","
The candidate report includes additional findings that are not mentioned in the reference report. These include the flattening of the diaphragms, the shape of the chest, and the unremarkable pulmonary vascularity. These are considered clinically insignificant errors as they do not alter the overall diagnosis or treatment plan but are not present in the reference report.
