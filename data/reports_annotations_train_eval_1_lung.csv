The lungs are hypoinflated. Small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.,"The lungs are hypoinflated. Costophrenic XXXX are blunted, XXXX corresponding to small bilateral pleural effusions. There is no focal consolidation or pneumothorax.","
The candidate report is largely accurate, with the same findings as the reference report. However, there is a minor discrepancy in the description of the pleural effusions. The reference report mentions ""small bilateral pleural effusions,"" while the candidate report describes ""Costophrenic XXXX are blunted, XXXX corresponding to small bilateral pleural effusions."" This could be considered a misidentification of a finding's anatomic location/position, but it is not clinically significant as it does not change the overall diagnosis or treatment plan.
