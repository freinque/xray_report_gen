Cardiac contours are within normal limits.,Cardiomediastinal silhouette is within normal limits.,"
The candidate report is essentially the same as the reference report, but uses a different term to describe the same finding. The term ""Cardiac contours"" in the reference report is replaced with ""Cardiomediastinal silhouette"" in the candidate report. Both terms refer to the same anatomical area and the same finding is reported as normal in both reports.

The term ""Cardiac contours"" in the reference report is replaced with ""Cardiomediastinal silhouette"" in the candidate report. Both terms refer to the same anatomical area and the same finding is reported as normal in both reports.
