Heart size is enlarged.,"Heart size is enlarged, pulmonary vascularity within normal limits.","
The candidate report includes an additional finding that the ""pulmonary vascularity is within normal limits"", which is not mentioned in the reference report. This is a clinically insignificant error as it does not change the overall diagnosis or treatment plan. The finding that the heart size is enlarged is correctly reported in both the reference and candidate reports.

The candidate report is more detailed than the reference report, mentioning the cardiomediastinal contour and pulmonary vascularity, which are not mentioned in the reference report. However, these additional details do not contradict the reference report's finding that the cardiac contours are within normal limits. Therefore, there are no clinically significant or insignificant errors.

The candidate report is specific about the heart's size, while the reference report is more general, stating that the size of the subject is normal. This could be interpreted as a misidentification of the anatomic location/position, but it is not necessarily clinically significant as the heart is often used as a stand-in for the size of the subject.
